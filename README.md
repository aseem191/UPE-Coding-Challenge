# UPE-Coding-Challenge
My solution to the UPE hangman solver.


Run request.py to make API requests to input letters to solve a Hangman puzzle, given a dictionary of popular English words named woords.txt. The algorithm managed to get about a 26% win rate over more than 100 games.


upecodingchallengeattempt.html was an attempt to create the same program and algorithm using JavaScript, but was not completed; I ended up using Python instead for the solution.
